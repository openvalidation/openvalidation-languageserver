# openVALIDATION Language Server Backend

[![npm version](https://badge.fury.io/js/openvalidation-languageserver-backend.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/js/openvalidation-languageserver-backend)

This package starts the REST-API of openVALIDATION specially for being used by the openVALIDATION-Language-Service.
Since the REST-API is written in Java the package loads the platform-specific openJDK version to run the generated JAR.

This only happens, when no Java ist installed on the system.
